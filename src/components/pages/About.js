        I am a graduate of Florida Gulf Coast University and have living in the Atlanta area for the past several years. Always working with a team, it is exciting to meet and learn about new people, and thanks main in part to the Georgia Tech Boot Camp for coding, I am able to explore the puzzle of website developement.
